I wrote you a song. Put it in the picoCTF{} flag format.

## Hint
Do you think you can master rockstar? 

## Solution 
```
wget http://lyrics.txt 
cat lyrics.txt
```
So you can see a fairly consistent syntax in this estoeric programming language. The problem is that is both guides link to an interpreter, which doesn't seem to be availabe on Github anymore (or is at least offline during this writing), nor its docs. I found an alternative interpreter, but it claimed there was a syntax error in the code. This is the problem with esoteric languages and a relatively small niche supporting them. 

## Flag
I have to give full credit to both resources below. Not sure I'd count this as a solve, but it was also not possible with the official resource being offline and secondary sources being limited. 

`picoCTF{rrrocknrn0113r}`
